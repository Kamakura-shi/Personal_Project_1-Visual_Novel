I created a program that produces a fully functional Visual Novel!

My goal is to create a game that makes use of ChatGPT to create infinite possibilities of dialogue

In a Hackathon, my brother's programming team tried it with RenPy, but it didn't give the right result. They discovered however that the module PyGame makes it possible to have dialogue with AI generated images

I will change RenPy for PyGame and I will replace the static images with "Stable Diffusion" to create any character from scratch
